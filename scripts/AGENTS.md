# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

- Own local workflow scripts and Expo config plugins that affect development startup or generated native behavior.

## Ownership

- [withExactAlarmPermissions.js](withExactAlarmPermissions.js) caps `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` at `maxSdkVersion=32` so exact alarms work on every Android version without triggering Google's exact-alarm declaration form.
- [free-port.js](free-port.js) frees a local TCP port before `pnpm web`, cross-platform.
- [test-timezones.js](test-timezones.js) runs the suite once per zone (UTC, Asia/Jerusalem, America/Los_Angeles, Pacific/Kiritimati). It puts `TZ` and `JEST_TZ` in the environment of the Jest process it spawns, so Node resolves the zone at startup and every worker inherits it. Extra arguments are forwarded to Jest.
- [jest-timezone-setup.js](jest-timezone-setup.js) is a Jest `setupFiles` guard. When `JEST_TZ` is set, it fails the run unless the test process really runs in that zone.
- [withMitzvahNotificationAction.js](withMitzvahNotificationAction.js) is an Expo config plugin that injects Android notification action handling.
- [check-dox.js](check-dox.js) enforces the mechanical half of the DOX contract: dead links, plain-text file references, section order, and Child DOX Index accuracy.
- [jest-asset-stub.js](jest-asset-stub.js) stands in for siddur asset modules under Jest, where Metro asset resolution does not exist.
- [publish-update.js](publish-update.js) backs every `pnpm update:*`. It reads the update messages EAS holds for the channel's branch and the [../app.json](../app.json) `version` (the runtime version, by the `appVersion` policy) and takes the next number: one above the highest `<version>-<n>:` message prefix, or, when no message carries one, one above the count of updates. It prefixes `--message` with `<version>-<n>: `, puts `n` in `EXPO_PUBLIC_UPDATE_NUMBER`, which Metro inlines into the bundle, and runs `eas update --clear-cache` so no cached transform keeps an older number. A branch EAS does not know yet starts at 1. It refuses to publish without `--message` or when EAS cannot list the branch.
- Script tests live in [__tests__/](__tests__/).
- [siddur/AGENTS.md](siddur/AGENTS.md) owns the siddur content build.

## Local Contracts

- Scripts must be plain Node and cross-platform. A shell-specific script silently breaks every non-Windows contributor and CI runner; that is why `pnpm web` no longer shells out to PowerShell.
- Scripts must be non-interactive: they run from `pnpm` scripts and in CI, where nothing can answer a prompt.
- The notification config plugin must stay aligned with scheduler constants in [../src/services/AGENTS.md](../src/services/AGENTS.md), especially `MARK_DONE`.
- Generated native folders are not owned here; the plugin source is the durable artifact.
- Set a test zone through the `env` of a spawned Jest process. Assigning `process.env.TZ` inside Jest does nothing, because `setupFiles` get a copy of `process.env`, so the clock never moves. A `TZ=` prefix in Git Bash is dropped for native programs as well; PowerShell `$env:TZ` and cmd `set TZ` do work.

## Work Guidance

- Prefer narrow script changes over adding new tools.
- For config plugin changes, reason through both manifest mutations and generated Kotlin output.

## Verification

- Run `pnpm web` or `node scripts/free-port.js <port>` after changing [free-port.js](free-port.js).
- Run `pnpm test:tz` after changing date or timezone handling.
- After changing [test-timezones.js](test-timezones.js) or [jest-timezone-setup.js](jest-timezone-setup.js), check that the guard still fails a run whose zone did not apply, e.g. `JEST_TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati npx jest src/theme` from Git Bash.
- Run `pnpm test -- scripts/__tests__/publishUpdate.test.js` after changing [publish-update.js](publish-update.js). For the inlining, `npx expo export --platform android --no-bytecode --clear` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_UPDATE_NUMBER` set must compile `appVersionLabel()` to that number, and to `0` without it.
- Run `pnpm doctor` after changing Expo config plugin behavior.
- Run `pnpm check:dox` after changing [check-dox.js](check-dox.js) itself, and confirm it still fails on a deliberately broken link before trusting a pass.
- Use a dev client or native build to verify Android notification-action behavior.

## Child DOX Index

- [siddur/AGENTS.md](siddur/AGENTS.md) - Build from pinned Sefaria and Wikisource sources to the bundled, day-conditioned nusach texts.
