## Purpose

- Own the build that turns pinned Sefaria and Hebrew Wikisource siddur sources into the bundled, day-conditioned nusach texts the reader shows.

## Ownership

- [build.js](build.js) downloads each pinned source once into a gitignored cache folder next to it, parses segments into runs, applies the manifest, fills English, validates, and writes [../../assets/siddur/](../../assets/siddur) plus [../../src/data/siddurAssets.generated.ts](../../src/data/siddurAssets.generated.ts). It rewrites only files whose content changed, so Metro's watcher keeps working.
- [build.js](build.js) classifies the sources' small print line by line: a vocalized line is text to say, an unvocalized one is an instruction, and a leading unvocalized label ending in ":" splits off a vocalized line.
- [build.js](build.js) removes Sefaria footnotes (`<sup class="footnote-marker">` and `<i class="footnote">`) whole, counting nested tags of the same name (`withoutElements()`), because a footnote that italicises a word inside itself used to leak its tail into the English of hundreds of segments. `parseEnglish()` also drops a leading list number ("3. ") that some community translations print.
- [../../src/data/__tests__/siddurDump.test.ts](../../src/data/__tests__/siddurDump.test.ts) prints built texts as the reader resolves them on chosen days, with each day's flags, skipped unless `SIDDUR_DUMP` is set; its header gives the variables. It is the way to check a manifest change against the source day by day.
- A Wikisource source is fetched through the MediaWiki API at its pinned revision. Its `path` is a list of parts joined by ` | `; each part is a `{{#קטע}}` label, or `A .. B` for the text between label A and label B. Known templates become runs; an unknown template fails the build.
- `flattenSmall` re-classifies a source that prints whole prayers in small print: it unwraps them and keeps only unvocalized fragments as instructions.
- `node scripts/siddur/build.js --inspect <sourceKey> "<path>"` prints a source leaf with its segment indices (`P`: small print promoted to said text, `N`: instruction only). Manifest indices come from this listing.
- [manifest.js](manifest.js) owns the source list (exact Sefaria version title or Wikisource revision, and credit) and, per text and nusach, the source section, range, groups, drops, edits, inserts, conditions, the passages only some say (`SOME_SAY` labels), the passages said only in a circumstance (`WHEN_SAID` labels), who says each passage only a minyan says (`SAID_BY` labels), and the per-nusach rule sets (`rule()`, `variant()`, `variantBefore()`) that turn the sources' inline alternatives into conditional runs.
- Two kinds of passage label exist, and a segment may carry both.
  - An optional label marks a passage the reader folds. `SOME_SAY` names a passage only some say. `WHEN_SAID` names a circumstance the date cannot decide: a house of mourning, an interruption between the hand and head tefillin, a fast day (open on public fasts), HaGomel, the bar mitzvah father's blessing, praying alone, women, the chazzan's Priestly Blessing when no kohanim go up (folded only in Israel for Ashkenaz), a meal begun before sunset on a day with an insert (below), a forgotten Yaaleh Veyavo, a sheva berachot meal, entering a city, travel by sea or air, the further Shema paragraphs at bedtime (Sefard), and the Chabad bedtime passage before marital relations. A spec's `optional` makes its whole section optional.
  - A minyan label (`SAID_BY`) names who says a passage only a minyan says: the chazzan, the chazzan with the congregation's answer, the repetition's Kedushah, Modim DeRabbanan and Priestly Blessing, the chazzan's Aneinu, mourners, the person called to the Torah, in the zimun the leader, the diners and one who did not eat, and `withMinyan` on each of the seven Sheva Berachot. The reader shows it open under its label. A spec's `minyan` labels each segment of that spec, but never its authored `insert` notes.
- The standalone texts are built like the mitzvah texts, each for all four nuschaot, with its builders near the end of [manifest.js](manifest.js):
  - Meals: `birkat_hamazon`, `al_hamichya`, `borei_nefashot`. Blessings: `asher_yatzar` (the morning blessings' own leaves, restricted to Asher Yatzar), `birchot_hanehenin` (washing, the six food blessings, fragrance, Shehecheyanu), `birchot_hareiya` (lightning and thunder, rainbow, the great sea, trees in blossom, further blessings of praise), `mezuzah`. Travel: `tefilat_haderech`. Night: `kriat_shema_al_hamita`, `kiddush_levana`. Occasions: `sheva_berachot`, `chanukah_candles`.
  - Where a nusach's usual source has no leaf: Ashkenaz takes Me'ein Shalosh, Borei Nefashot, Tefilat HaDerech, the food blessings, the sights, the mezuzah and Chanukah from Daat Siddur Ashkenaz (`DAAT`, `daatName` for its bare "יי" and hyphenated names; Daat prints instructions as plain text, so an edit wraps each in `<small>`), its fragrance blessings and Sheva Berachot from the Metsudah Shabbat siddur (Sheva Berachot verified letter-identical to Hebrew Wikisource Ashkenaz, revision 3078438, which is not pinned), and its Kiddush Levana ending from its own Maariv Aleinu and mourners' Kaddish. Sefard takes Me'ein Shalosh, Borei Nefashot, Tefilat HaDerech, the mezuzah, Kiddush Levana and Chanukah from Torat Emet (`TORAT_EMET`, Hebrew only; English only through the translation memory), and the second and third bedtime Shema paragraphs from its own Maariv leaf. Edot HaMizrach takes Hatov Vehametiv from Metsudah Shabbat. Chabad takes the Ten Days "השלום" of the Kiddush Levana Kaddish from its own Maariv Kaddish.
  - The English of Ashkenaz Daat texts is the Sefaria Community Translation, used only where it aligns by index.
- Birkat HaMazon, by the user's decision of 2026-10-08: Retzei / VeHachalitzenu, the Shabbat and Yom Tov Harachaman lines, the Yom Tov and Rosh Hashana days of Yaaleh Veyavo and the Shabbat / Yom Tov forgetting blessings are dropped, never shown. Yaaleh Veyavo carries only Rosh Chodesh and Chol HaMoed; the Rosh Chodesh forgetting blessing is its own optional section, on Rosh Chodesh only. "Migdol" follows `musaf` where the source says so (Edot HaMizrach adds `motzaeiShabbat` and `purim`); the Metsudah texts drop their Shabbat / Yom Tov alternative.
- Nothing said only on Shabbat or Yom Tov appears in a standalone text, because the app is never active inside a holy block (the user's Birkat HaMazon decision of 2026-10-08, applied to every standalone text); a passage skipped on those days carries `none: ['shabbat','yomTov']`. An evening text (`evening: true` in its registry entry) is conditioned on the Hebrew day whose night it is said on, so the bedtime Shema's Vidui follows `tachanunShacharit` of the next morning and the Chanukah first-night Shehecheyanu follows `chanukahFirstNight`.
- A meal begun before sunset keeps yesterday's insert. The day flags `roshChodeshYesterday`, `cholHamoedPesachYesterday`, `cholHamoedSukkotYesterday`, `chanukahYesterday` and `purimYesterday` hold on the day after, only when the day has no insert of that kind itself. Every Yaaleh Veyavo, Al HaNissim and Harachaman-of-the-day segment is conditioned on the day or its "yesterday" flag (`YAALEH_VEYAVO_OR_YESTERDAY` and friends) and folded under `WHEN_SAID.mealBeganYaalehVeyavo` / `mealBeganAlHanissim`, whose own `when` holds only on the day after, so the day itself shows the insert open.
- `optionalParts` and `minyanParts` take `[{ from, to, paragraph, until, label, englishInPart }]` and mark a run of segments inside a section. `paragraph` cuts the `from` segment where the run starts, and `until` cuts the `to` segment where it ends. The source English stays with the first piece unless `englishInPart`. A label may carry its own `when`, so the passage folds only on the days it is disputed.

## Local Contracts

- Both outputs are generated. Never hand-edit an asset or the generated map; change the manifest and run `pnpm siddur:build`.
- Every source pins an exact Sefaria version title or Wikisource revision id and carries a credit (title, license, URL). CC-BY and CC-BY-SA credits must reach the output; the reader displays them.
- The build fails, and must keep failing, on:
  - an edit that does not match exactly once;
  - a manifest rule that never matches, so a source update cannot silently drop a variant;
  - an edit, condition, group or `reviewed` index that targets a segment outside the selected range;
  - an omer section that does not carry exactly 49 days, each with its own date label;
  - an instruction note that names a day (`CONDITIONAL_INSTRUCTION`) on a segment with no condition and no `reviewed` entry;
  - such a note in the middle of said text without its own run condition, even inside a conditioned segment, because that is an unresolved inline alternative;
  - small print promoted to said text on an unconditioned segment, unless `reviewed` or matched by `ALWAYS_SAID`;
  - a passage label without Hebrew and English;
  - two optional parts, or two minyan parts, that overlap;
  - a labeled part that matches no text or cuts past a segment's last paragraph;
  - both `minyan` and `minyanParts` on one spec;
  - a group that mixes labeled and unlabeled text;
  - merged sections that disagree on `optional`.

  Fix the manifest; never widen a pattern to silence one.
- Fold a passage behind an optional label only when the source itself marks it as said by only some ("יש נוהגים / יש אומרים / ויש שמוסיפים / מי שרוצה"), or as said only in a circumstance the date cannot decide ("בבית האבל אומרים", "יחיד אומר", "נשים אומרות", "אם אין כהנים"). The user chose the first rule on 2026-10-05 and added the second on 2026-10-07; kabbalistic additions the source prints as regular text, such as Leshem Yichud, stay regular. Drop the source note a label replaces.
- A passage a source prints once but says belongs after each of several day-conditioned alternatives (Hoshienu joined to Friday's Song of the Day in Edot HaMizrach) is split out of that day's condition with an inline `<if>`, never left tagged with one day.
- The 13 Middot carry `SAID_BY.withMinyan`.
- Where sources or customs disagree, the user decided on 2026-10-07:
  - Ashkenaz daily Vidui and the 13 Middot fold as "some say", at Shacharit and Mincha.
  - Edot HaMizrach LeDavid Hashem Ori folds as "some say", all year.
  - Sefard Hoshienu after the Song of the Day takes the Psalms wording from Torat Emet, as in Edot HaMizrach and Chabad, not Metsudah's Divrei HaYamim wording.
  - Sefard and Chabad return the Torah after Uva Letzion and before Kaddish Titkabel.
  - Sefard Mincha says Avinu Malkeinu after Nefilat Apayim, as at Shacharit.
  - The second Kaddish on Purim night has no Titkabel.
  - Edot HaMizrach's "three fasts" Aneinu shows only on Tzom Gedaliah, Asara B'Tevet and Tzom Tammuz.
- Every Kaddish, Barchu, Kedushah, Modim DeRabbanan and Priestly Blessing carries a minyan label; [../../src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts](../../src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts) fails on one that does not. Kaddish Titkabel and half Kaddish are the chazzan's, and Kaddish Yatom and DeRabbanan are the mourners'. The congregation's answer to the chazzan outside the repetition, such as the answer to Barchu or the Torah-reading responses, sits inside the chazzan's block. The user decided both on 2026-10-05.
- Drop or edit out a source note once a label says the same thing, such as "בחזרת הש״ץ אומרים כאן קדושה", and keep notes that add information. Weekday Maariv has no repetition, so the Ashkenaz source's Kedushah note in Maariv is dropped.
- An `insert` is an authored instruction, never authored liturgy. It points at what the weekday text does not carry (the fast-day Torah reading, the erev Yom Kippur vidui, Eichah, disputed Tachanun) and carries its own condition.
- Tag a segment with a condition only when the rule is certain for that nusach. Anything uncertain stays visible with its own instruction.
- Havdalah follows what it closes, through positive conditions: spices only on `motzaeiShabbat` (never on Tisha B'Av), the flame on `motzaeiShabbat` or `dayAfterYomKippur`. Motzaei Yom Tov and the Sunday night after a Tisha B'Av fast carry no flag, so they come out as wine and Hamavdil. Edot HaMizrach's opening instruction names the spices, so it is tagged like them, with an authored instruction without spices for the other nights. The verses stay visible everywhere the sources are silent; only Ashkenaz, whose Metsudah Yom Kippur machzor marks it, gets a note to skip them after a weekday Yom Kippur.
- One nusach's wording may be taken from another source only when it is verified identical. Current cases: Ashkenaz candle lighting and havdalah come from the Metsudah Shabbat siddur (havdalah verified identical to Daat Siddur Ashkenaz); Chabad candle lighting and havdalah are derived from it with the Chabad divine name and "שבת קודש"; every nusach's Yom Kippur candle lighting comes from the Metsudah Yom Kippur machzor. In Shacharit, Ashkenaz Hallel comes from the Metsudah Shabbat siddur (verified identical to Wikisource Ashkenaz) and its Musaf middle blessing from Hebrew Wikisource; Sefard Musaf combines Metsudah Shabbat and Torat Emet; the lulav blessing comes from Metsudah Shabbat, and Edot HaMizrach takes only its blessings. Ashkenaz's house-of-mourning Psalms 49 and 16 come from Metsudah Sefard (identical to the Masoretic text in its qere), and the chatimah of the chazzan's Ashkenaz Aneinu from Hebrew Wikisource, after the Metsudah body. Four authored havdalah notes join them: the flame that rested on motzaei Yom Kippur, the flame-only night when Tisha B'Av begins at havdalah, the Ashkenaz verses after a weekday Yom Kippur, and the Edot HaMizrach instruction without spices. These are the first items for halachic review.
- English is the aligned translation of the same source, else an exact normalized-Hebrew match from the Metsudah translation memory, else nothing. A source translation that stops aligning by index partway through a leaf is used only up to that point; the rest of the leaf is built without `en`. Omer counts without a source translation take Hebcal's English. No other translation is ever written.
- Hebrew is normalized to NFC; the sources store nikud in non-canonical order.

## Work Guidance

- New text: register its id in [../../src/data/siddur.ts](../../src/data/siddur.ts) (a mitzvah text in `SIDDUR_TEXTS`, a standalone one in `STANDALONE_TEXTS` with its name and group, and its id in [../../src/types/siddur.ts](../../src/types/siddur.ts)), add a manifest entry for all four nuschaot, rebuild, and extend [../../src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts](../../src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts) with dated cases.
- Open halachic-review items from the standalone texts:
  - Meals: Sefard Me'ein Shalosh names Chol HaMoed in the "vesamchenu" line, which Torat Emet prints for Yom Tov only; the Chabad "migdol" and Me'ein Shalosh endings follow the Chabad source, with no Israel / abroad variant; the Edot HaMizrach forgetting blessing on Rosh Chodesh drops the divine name and the chatimah, as its own instruction says; the Sefard Purim line of Al HaNissim and the zimun speaker notes are authored, after the English of the same source.
  - Bedtime Shema: one Sefard fold label covers both further paragraphs; Edot's Vidui follows Tachanun of the next morning, with its midnight sentence on motzaei nights; the Chabad omissions on Shabbat, Yom Tov and Chol HaMoed rest on the Sefer HaMinhagim, and the four court penalties (#14-#17) stay visible every night; the Chabad passage before marital relations is folded for every reader.
  - Sights and food: Birkat HaIlanot's Nisan instruction stays visible all year; the Sefard great sea and tall mountains instruction is rendered from Metsudah's English; the great sea blessing exists only where Ashkenaz and Sefard sources print it.
  - Kiddush Levana: Sefard follows Torat Emet's wording ("ויהי", "אלמלי") rather than Metsudah Shabbat's; the catalog offers it from the 3rd while the Sefard and Chabad sources say to wait seven days; Edot prints no Ten Days Kaddish variant.
  - Sheva Berachot: the Sefard order (Borei Pri HaGafen last) and its wording ("משמח חתן", without "במהרה") follow Metsudah Sefard; Chabad prints no instruction.
  - Chanukah: Ashkenaz shows Daat's optional "של" in "נר [של] חנוכה" as a note; Shehecheyanu shows on the first night only, with no note for one who missed it; the Chabad source prints only the blessings and Hanerot Hallalu.
- New day-dependent insert: add the flag to [../../src/types/siddur.ts](../../src/types/siddur.ts) and [../../src/utils/siddur.ts](../../src/utils/siddur.ts) with a dated test first, then tag the manifest.
- Map a leaf with `--inspect` before writing its spec, and give every conditional segment its own `at` entry.
- Inline alternatives inside a segment become `<if all|any|none="flag">…</if>` runs. A pattern the source repeats goes in the nusach's rule set; a one-off goes in an `if` edit.
- Section titles must be unique among the sections shown on any one day: the reader keys and scrolls by them. Consecutive specs with the same title merge into one section, and mutually exclusive sections may share a title. [../../src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts](../../src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts) checks this across sample days.

## Verification

- `pnpm siddur:build` passes, and running it a second time changes no output file.
- `pnpm test -- src/data/__tests__/siddur.test.ts src/utils/__tests__/siddur.test.ts`.
