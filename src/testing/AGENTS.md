# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

- Own fixture helpers that exist only for the test suite.

## Ownership

- [zmanim.ts](zmanim.ts) resolves zmanim for a fixture and throws when they are unavailable, so a bad fixture fails loudly instead of returning `null` into an assertion.
- [zmanim.ts](zmanim.ts) also owns `at(location, wallClock)`, the instant a clock at the location shows, so a fixture means the same moment under every device zone. It throws on an unparseable wall clock.
- [render.tsx](render.tsx) owns `renderWithTheme(ui)`: React Native Testing Library's `render` with `ThemeProvider` as the wrapper, so a component that calls `useTheme()` or `useI18n()` renders as it does in the app. The theme and the language come from `useUserStore`; a test picks them with `useUserStore.setState({ theme, language })` and resets with `useUserStore.getState().reset()` in `beforeEach`. It also owns `findBackdrop()`, the press target behind a dialog or sheet, which has no role to query by.

## Local Contracts

- Nothing under [../](../) that ships in the app may import from this folder. It is test-only by contract, not by convention.
- Helpers here may throw. That is the point: in a fixture an impossible value is a broken test, whereas in production the same value is a state the app must survive — see the `null` contract in [../services/AGENTS.md](../services/AGENTS.md).
- Do not put these files under a `__tests__/` folder; Jest would collect them as suites with no tests.
- Shipped code never imports [render.tsx](render.tsx): it pulls in `@testing-library/react-native`, a devDependency that must stay out of the app bundle.
- Importing `@testing-library/react-native` registers its Jest matchers (`toBeOnTheScreen`, `toBeDisabled`, `toBeSelected`, `toHaveStyle`) and the automatic cleanup after each test, so [package.json](../../package.json) needs no `setupFilesAfterEnv`. `react-native-mmkv` falls back to its in-memory mock under Jest by itself, so a render test needs no `jest.mock` for the stores.
- `ConfirmDialog` and `BottomSheet` render nothing while `useQuietBlock()` is non-null; a test puts a block in `QuietBlockContext.Provider` instead of faking the clock.

## Work Guidance

- Add a helper only when the same fixture setup is repeated across suites, and keep it small enough to read at a glance.
- A helper must never encode expected behavior. Assertions belong in the test that makes the claim.
- In a render test, `fireEvent.press` and `fireEvent(el, 'longPress')` walk up to the nearest ancestor with that handler prop, and that ancestor can be the component under test when its own prop is named `onPress` or `onLongPress`: a handler dropped from the inner `Pressable` still passes. Press such a component with `userEvent.setup().press()` / `.longPress()`, which drives the host element's own responder, and confirm the test fails once the handler is removed from the component.

## Verification

- Run `pnpm test` after changing a helper; every suite that uses it must still pass.
- Run `pnpm typecheck` after changing a helper signature.
