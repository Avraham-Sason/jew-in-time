# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

- Own persisted Zustand stores and persistence middleware.

## Ownership

- [useUserStore.ts](useUserStore.ts) owns user profile, location, language, theme (a `ThemeName`, `gold` by default), permission, settings, onboarding state, the reader text size, the reader's auto-scroll (`siddurAutoScroll`, off by default, and `siddurScrollSpeed`, a 1-based level into the fifteen `SIDDUR_SCROLL_SPEEDS`, 5 to 150 lines per minute, that `scrollSpeedLevel()` keeps in range), `prayerMode` (`minyan` by default, or `alone`: whether the siddur folds what is said only with a minyan; Settings and the reader header write the same field), the `hilulotEnabled` switch for hilula notices (off by default), `gender` and `maritalStatus` (`married` or `single`), each `null` until answered, and the `taharahEnabled` opt-in.
- [useMitzvotStore.ts](useMitzvotStore.ts) owns enabled mitzvot and custom reminders, and `enabledAt`, the moment each was last switched on (`enabledSinceOf()`), so switching a mitzvah on never turns earlier days into misses. A missing `enabledAt` means since before it was recorded. A screen reads one mitzvah's state through `selectActive(id)`, which returns the frozen `INACTIVE` for an id the map lacks (a deleted custom mitzvah): a selector that built a fresh `{ enabled: false }` re-rendered without end.
- [useCompletionsStore.ts](useCompletionsStore.ts) owns completions and skipped maps, finished check-ins (`checkIns`, keyed by a block's first holy day) and `archivedDays`, the runs of kept days that retention dropped.
- [useCustomMitzvotStore.ts](useCustomMitzvotStore.ts) owns user-created mitzvah definitions.
- [useTaharahStore.ts](useTaharahStore.ts) owns the taharah log (raw `TaharahEvent`s), the minhag settings (preset, per-rule overrides, role), the reminder lead times and the discreet-notification and lock switches. Everything shown about a cycle is derived from the events by [../utils/taharah/](../utils/taharah).
- [taharahOptIn.ts](taharahOptIn.ts) owns the cross-store opt-in calls: `chooseGender()`, `chooseMaritalStatus()`, `setTaharahTracking()` and `chooseNusach()` write the user store, then apply the taharah store rule. `chooseGender()` also applies the gender defaults to the library: a change to `female` switches `MENS_MITZVOT` (tefillin, tzitzit) off, a change from `female` to `male` switches them on, and re-choosing the same answer touches nothing, so a choice made in the library survives. `taharahOffered()` is the one answer to whether the taharah topic is shown: a gender is chosen and the user is married. The onboarding steps and the Settings tab call only these, and read the offer through `taharahOffered()` only.
- [zustandMiddleware.ts](zustandMiddleware.ts) owns Zustand middleware interop.
- Store tests live in [__tests__/](__tests__/).

## Local Contracts

- Stores persist through MMKV using [../services/StorageService.ts](../services/StorageService.ts). The one exception is `useTaharahStore`, which persists to its own encrypted instance through [../services/TaharahStorage.ts](../services/TaharahStorage.ts). Taharah data never goes into a plain store, and nothing outside this store and its reset path imports `taharahStorage`.
- Keep persisted defaults, reset behavior, and migrations/backward compatibility in sync when adding fields.
- Every `persist()` passes `migrate` from [persistOptions.ts](persistOptions.ts), the identity until a real shape change needs a step: zustand drops the whole persisted state on a version mismatch without one. The store tests pin it per store through `store.persist.getOptions()`.
- `locationStatus` starts as `missing`: the default city is a guess until GPS or a city pick writes `ready`, and home shows the no-location banner until then.
- Every `persist()` passes `version` and `onRehydrateStorage` from [persistOptions.ts](persistOptions.ts). A store that persists somewhere other than the plain MMKV instance passes that storage as the second argument, or a corrupt payload is dropped from the wrong place and fails again next launch. A store whose state is a keyed map also needs a `merge` that unions the current defaults back in, or entries added in a later release never reach existing users; `useTaharahStore` does that for `settings.rules`, filling a missing rule from the saved preset; a saved preset id this build does not know (a rollback) falls back to the current preset label while the saved rules, events and leads are kept, because a throw inside `merge` drops the whole store.
- A new top-level field on a store merges in through zustand's default shallow merge, so adding one (`gender`, `maritalStatus`, `taharahEnabled`) needs a default and a `reset()` entry but no `STORE_VERSION` bump. [useUserStore.ts](useUserStore.ts) has a `merge`, `mergeSavedUserState`, only to repair an old payload. It infers `maritalStatus`: a saved payload with `taharahEnabled` on and no status reads as `married`. It also maps a saved `theme`: a known name is kept, the legacy `system` becomes `dark` when the OS appearance is dark at hydrate time and `gold` otherwise, and the legacy `light` and anything unknown become `gold`.
- `useTaharahStore` is the only place a gender or a nusach becomes a taharah role and preset: `startTracking(gender, nusach)` (tracking switched on), `setRoleForGender(gender)` (gender changed while tracking) and `adoptPresetFor(nusach)` (nusach picked in onboarding). A preset is adopted only while the store is untouched, meaning no events and rules identical to the current preset's own, so a hand-edited rule or a recorded cycle is never overwritten; the guard exists once, here, and no screen repeats it. Screens reach these actions only through [taharahOptIn.ts](taharahOptIn.ts), so the gender, marital status, tracking and nusach rules cannot drift between onboarding and Settings.
- Tracking is switched on only through `setTaharahTracking()` while `taharahOffered()` holds; a call outside the offer is ignored and writes nothing. `chooseMaritalStatus()` with anything but `married` switches tracking off while it is on, and the taharah store keeps its events and settings.
- `AppResetService` resets `useTaharahStore` and then wipes its storage and replaces its key with `clearTaharahStorage()`; a new taharah field needs a default in `initialData()` so that reset covers it.
- Completion maps are pruned to `RETENTION_DAYS` on hydrate and must never write empty day buckets. The days pruned away are folded into `archivedDays` first (`archiveMarkedDays()`), and finished check-ins are pruned with the same cutoff.
- `finishCheckIn()` is idempotent and withdraws the block's check-in reminders through the same queued `require()` the completion actions use. `markDone` and `markSkipped` also call `settleCheckIn()`, so the mark that empties a check-in withdraws its reminders too.
- `useCompletionsStore.markDone`, `markSkipped`, and `unmark` must preserve notification cancellation/rebuild side effects.
- Do not replace the deliberate `../../node_modules/zustand/middleware.js` require in [zustandMiddleware.ts](zustandMiddleware.ts) unless Metro and Jest are both verified.

## Work Guidance

- Keep store actions small and explicit.
- Avoid putting pure derived calculations in stores when [../utils/AGENTS.md](../utils/AGENTS.md) can own them.

## Verification

- Run `pnpm test -- src/stores/__tests__/stores.test.ts src/stores/__tests__/completions.extra.test.ts` after store behavior changes.
- Run `pnpm test -- src/stores/__tests__/taharahStore.test.ts src/stores/__tests__/taharahOptIn.test.ts src/services/__tests__/TaharahStorage.test.ts src/services/__tests__/AppResetService.test.ts` after taharah store, opt-in, storage or reset changes.
- Run notification scheduler tests after completion/skipped state changes that affect reminders.
- Run `pnpm typecheck` after store type changes.
